1
00:00:02,134 --> 00:00:03,758
Come here! Come here!
Come here!

2
00:00:03,759 --> 00:00:04,960
You got to see this.

3
00:00:04,961 --> 00:00:06,994
I'm about to give
Captain Holt his gift.

4
00:00:07,029 --> 00:00:09,364
Oh, did he lift
his "no gift" policy?

5
00:00:09,365 --> 00:00:10,632
No, he didn't.

6
00:00:10,633 --> 00:00:12,734
But I figured out a way
to buy him something

7
00:00:12,735 --> 00:00:14,769
and trick him
into accepting it.

8
00:00:14,770 --> 00:00:17,005
- You are bad.
- I know, right?

9
00:00:17,006 --> 00:00:18,439
Oh, wait.
You're making fun of me.

10
00:00:18,474 --> 00:00:20,041
- Mm-hmm.
- Well, I don't care.

11
00:00:20,042 --> 00:00:21,676
He would never open a gift,
right?

12
00:00:21,677 --> 00:00:24,345
But what if his gift
didn't look like a gift?

13
00:00:24,380 --> 00:00:26,214
- He would open it?
- Exactly!

14
00:00:26,215 --> 00:00:28,416
I left it in a cardboard box
on his desk.

15
00:00:28,417 --> 00:00:30,685
There's no card,
just the words "Open now,"

16
00:00:30,686 --> 00:00:32,153
which I wrote with my wrong hand

17
00:00:32,188 --> 00:00:35,023
so he wouldn't recognize
my handwriting.

18
00:00:35,024 --> 00:00:36,191
- Captain.
- Santiago. Peralta.

19
00:00:36,192 --> 00:00:37,191
Sir.

20
00:00:37,193 --> 00:00:38,627
So just to recap,

21
00:00:38,628 --> 00:00:41,062
you left an unmarked package
on a police captain's desk

22
00:00:41,063 --> 00:00:43,064
on a random Monday,
with a suspicious message

23
00:00:43,065 --> 00:00:44,065
written on it that looked like

24
00:00:44,066 --> 00:00:45,333
it was scrawled
by a crazy person.

25
00:00:45,334 --> 00:00:47,302
- Mm-hmm.
- Bomb! There's a bomb!

26
00:00:47,303 --> 00:00:49,337
Everyone out!
Let's go, let's go!

27
00:00:49,338 --> 00:00:50,698
This is not a drill!

28
00:00:50,706 --> 00:00:52,908
Let's go!

29
00:00:52,909 --> 00:00:55,109
Great gift, babe.

Ah.

- Holy crap! I love this stuff!

37
00:01:27,310 --> 00:01:29,411
You know, technically,
it's just carbonated fudge.

38
00:01:29,412 --> 00:01:30,412
- I know.
- I thought they banned it.

39
00:01:30,413 --> 00:01:31,513
Not in Syria.

40
00:01:31,514 --> 00:01:33,582
They use it to induce labor
in goats.

And your real present
arrives tomorrow.

42
00:01:36,052 --> 00:01:38,119
There's more?
Charles, this is too much.

43
00:01:38,120 --> 00:01:39,387
Nonsense!

44
00:01:39,388 --> 00:01:40,989
It was just a lot of time
and a lot of money.

45
00:01:40,990 --> 00:01:42,423
Oh.

46
00:01:44,293 --> 00:01:45,594
Gina!
I screwed up.

47
00:01:45,595 --> 00:01:46,895
I forgot to get
Charles anything.

48
00:01:46,896 --> 00:01:48,996
Oh, well, I always knew
he would die of sadness.

49
00:01:49,031 --> 00:01:50,332
I'm such a selfish jerk.

50
00:01:50,333 --> 00:01:51,833
I was just so focused
on Amy's gift

51
00:01:51,834 --> 00:01:52,834
that I completely spaced.

52
00:01:52,868 --> 00:01:54,536
His present to me was
so personal.

53
00:01:54,537 --> 00:01:56,571
All right, think.
What does Charles love?

54
00:01:56,572 --> 00:01:59,007
Gross food, tan pants,
"MasterChef Junior."

55
00:01:59,008 --> 00:02:00,408
Ooh, I could call up
one of those kids

56
00:02:00,409 --> 00:02:01,676
and offer them a free trip
to New York.

57
00:02:01,677 --> 00:02:02,701
I wouldn't do that.

58
00:02:02,712 --> 00:02:03,979
Right, 'cause I'm a stranger,

59
00:02:03,980 --> 00:02:05,180
and I shouldn't be luring them
out of state.

60
00:02:05,181 --> 00:02:06,881
- Good call.
- Jake, just go to Goodwin's.

61
00:02:06,882 --> 00:02:08,650
They're open late,
and they have everything.

62
00:02:08,651 --> 00:02:10,585
Right. Smart.
Please come with me.

63
00:02:10,586 --> 00:02:11,785
Please, I need help
picking something out.

64
00:02:11,821 --> 00:02:13,955
Please, Gina?

65
00:02:13,956 --> 00:02:15,690
I'll take a pic of Terry
in the locker room for you.

66
00:02:15,691 --> 00:02:18,960
No towel, with his foot up
on the bench.

67
00:02:18,961 --> 00:02:20,862
Towel on, still wet
from the shower.

68
00:02:20,863 --> 00:02:22,029
I'm in.

69
00:02:22,064 --> 00:02:23,164
Hey, guys.
What's up?

70
00:02:23,165 --> 00:02:25,165
Nothing.

71
00:02:27,370 --> 00:02:29,604
Diaz, are we still on
for the Polar Bear Swim tonight?

72
00:02:29,605 --> 00:02:31,006
It's either that or go
caroling with my family,

73
00:02:31,007 --> 00:02:32,274
so, yeah.

74
00:02:32,275 --> 00:02:33,375
I'd rather walk into
the freezing ocean.

75
00:02:33,376 --> 00:02:34,476
Wait, what?

76
00:02:34,477 --> 00:02:35,510
You guys are doing
the polar swim?

77
00:02:35,511 --> 00:02:36,811
Why didn't you ask me?

78
00:02:36,812 --> 00:02:37,902
Oh, we didn't think
you'd be interested.

79
00:02:37,913 --> 00:02:39,247
Yeah, you're always cold.

80
00:02:39,248 --> 00:02:41,583
You brought a blanket
to a Mets game in mid-July.

81
00:02:41,584 --> 00:02:46,036
This one thinks
July 18th is mid-July.

82
00:02:47,323 --> 00:02:49,858
You guys think I'm some kind
of wimp, but I'm not.

83
00:02:49,859 --> 00:02:52,193
I am tough, and I'm strong,

84
00:02:52,194 --> 00:02:54,194
and I love to splash around
in chilly water.

85
00:02:54,230 --> 00:02:56,064
It's not chilly, it's as cold

86
00:02:56,065 --> 00:02:59,033
as the waters of Cocytus,
the frozen lake of hell.

87
00:02:59,068 --> 00:03:00,602
I'll see you there.

88
00:03:00,603 --> 00:03:02,370
I can't wait to dunk my junk.

89
00:03:05,741 --> 00:03:07,308
Okay, gang.
I'm out.

90
00:03:07,343 --> 00:03:08,810
I'll be back on the 27th.

91
00:03:08,811 --> 00:03:10,912
I've got two days
of family time.

92
00:03:10,913 --> 00:03:12,713
Do not attempt to contact me.

93
00:03:12,748 --> 00:03:14,683
I do not want a repeat
of last year

94
00:03:14,684 --> 00:03:17,185
when Scully called me 50 times
on Christmas morning.

95
00:03:17,186 --> 00:03:19,154
No.
I called you once.

96
00:03:19,155 --> 00:03:20,387
My butt called the other 49.

97
00:03:20,423 --> 00:03:22,724
Yeah, well, my brother-in-law
Zeke was real judgy

98
00:03:22,725 --> 00:03:25,393
about how much
my phone was buzzing.

99
00:03:29,932 --> 00:03:33,301
Somebody's got
a lot of business to tend to.

100
00:03:33,302 --> 00:03:35,836
Who are you?
Barbara Corcoran?

101
00:03:35,871 --> 00:03:37,939
He didn't even make me
one of the good sharks.

102
00:03:37,940 --> 00:03:39,207
I'm clearly Lori.

103
00:03:39,208 --> 00:03:41,910
Nobody call me.

104
00:03:41,911 --> 00:03:43,411
Gina!

105
00:03:43,412 --> 00:03:46,514
It's our first annual
Boyle-Linetti Christmas.

106
00:03:46,515 --> 00:03:48,917
Are you excited about going
to town on Daddy's nog?

107
00:03:48,918 --> 00:03:51,186
Christmas is cancelled.
Charles ruined it.

108
00:03:51,187 --> 00:03:52,253
I'm gonna be a little late.

109
00:03:52,254 --> 00:03:53,588
I got to help Jake
do some shopping.

110
00:03:53,589 --> 00:03:55,724
Oh, last-minute gifts.

111
00:03:55,725 --> 00:03:57,625
Ooh, who didn't make the cut?

112
00:03:57,626 --> 00:04:01,196
Tell me, Jake, who's the poor
sack at the bottom of your list?

113
00:04:01,197 --> 00:04:04,766
Actually, Amy.

114
00:04:04,767 --> 00:04:08,770
- Amy? Oof! That's bad.
- Mm-hmm.

115
00:04:08,771 --> 00:04:10,305
Just give her
whatever you got me.

116
00:04:10,306 --> 00:04:11,506
Really?

117
00:04:11,507 --> 00:04:14,275
But then I wouldn't have
a gift for you.

118
00:04:14,276 --> 00:04:15,242
Would you be cool with that?

119
00:04:15,277 --> 00:04:16,945
No, that would eviscerate me.

120
00:04:16,946 --> 00:04:18,213
I'll get my coat.

121
00:04:18,214 --> 00:04:19,714
I'm gonna help you
find something for her.

122
00:04:19,715 --> 00:04:22,116
- Oh, that's not necessary.
- Buh, buh, buh, buh, buh, Jake.

123
00:04:22,151 --> 00:04:24,085
Also not necessary
to touch my face.

124
00:04:24,086 --> 00:04:26,788
It's Christmas.
A time for friendship.

125
00:04:26,789 --> 00:04:27,989
Damn it.
All right.

126
00:04:27,990 --> 00:04:29,224
I guess you'll just
have to distract him

127
00:04:29,225 --> 00:04:30,692
- when we get to the store.
- On it.

128
00:04:30,693 --> 00:04:32,227
I'll take him to housewares
and I'll ask him

129
00:04:32,228 --> 00:04:34,562
the difference between a skillet
and a frying pan.

130
00:04:34,563 --> 00:04:36,498
- That'll buy you six hours.
- Perfect.

131
00:04:36,499 --> 00:04:38,199
Gina, you just saved Christmas.

132
00:04:38,200 --> 00:04:40,535
It's what I do.

133
00:04:40,536 --> 00:04:42,836
Every damn year.

134
00:04:42,872 --> 00:04:43,912
- Good night.
- Good night.

135
00:04:45,841 --> 00:04:47,776
Wait! No, no, no, no, no!
Don't lock the door!

136
00:04:47,777 --> 00:04:49,811
I just need to buy one thing.
I'll be so fast,

137
00:04:49,812 --> 00:04:50,912
I won't even pay!

138
00:04:50,913 --> 00:04:52,046
How did that not work?

139
00:04:52,047 --> 00:04:53,148
Hey, there's still
people in there.

140
00:04:53,149 --> 00:04:54,382
They're not closed.

141
00:04:54,383 --> 00:04:56,718
First time at a retail store,
Oliver Twist?

142
00:04:56,719 --> 00:04:58,987
They lock the doors,
but if you're still inside,

143
00:04:58,988 --> 00:05:00,989
you get an extra 15 minutes
to finish up.

144
00:05:00,990 --> 00:05:02,857
Oh, perfect, so we should just
try and sneak in

145
00:05:02,858 --> 00:05:03,958
an entrance through the back.

146
00:05:03,959 --> 00:05:04,959
Boyle, you'll have to stay here.

147
00:05:04,960 --> 00:05:06,094
It's too dangerous.

148
00:05:06,095 --> 00:05:07,628
No way I let you take
that risk alone.

149
00:05:07,663 --> 00:05:09,330
Damn it, you are loyal.

150
00:05:09,331 --> 00:05:10,398

the approach to fish skin
is completely different.

Let's go.

00:05:30,319 --> 00:05:31,986
Oh, let's take a peep
at that purchase.

161
00:05:31,987 --> 00:05:34,122
- Cologne?
- Uh, it's perfume.

162
00:05:34,123 --> 00:05:36,825
- For a lady. Woman.
- It's called "Canyon Stank."

163
00:05:36,826 --> 00:05:38,725
It's got a man riding
a burro on it.

164
00:05:38,761 --> 00:05:41,729
Oh, does it? I didn't notice.
I just like the way it smelled.

165
00:05:41,730 --> 00:05:44,331
I wear this cologne, Jake.
I'm a Stank man.

166
00:05:44,366 --> 00:05:46,434
Um, I don't know,
maybe just subconsciously

167
00:05:46,435 --> 00:05:49,370
I wanted Amy
to smell more like you.

168
00:05:49,371 --> 00:05:52,639
Okay, little creepy, bud.
Coming on real strong.

169

They've blocked all the exits,

208
00:07:34,943 --> 00:07:36,209
they've taken
the security guards hostage,

209
00:07:36,244 --> 00:07:38,045

- No need.

253

- I snagged this on the way here.
- "Baby Grrl"?

254
00:09:10,505 --> 00:09:12,006
Yeah, they didn't have
the best selection.

Christina Rossetti.

268
00:09:39,901 --> 00:09:43,636
"In the bleak mid-winter,
frosty wind made moan,

269
00:09:43,672 --> 00:09:47,308
Earth stood hard as iron,
water like a stone."

- Me!

305

Why are you calling yourself
"He"?

306
00:11:20,769 --> 00:11:22,302
Because that's the tagline
from the "Die Hard" poster,

307
00:11:22,303 --> 00:11:23,971
and also
my high school yearbook quote.

00:11:26,207 --> 00:11:28,208

Also, there aren't 12 of them.

310
00:11:28,209 --> 00:11:30,177
There are seven, and they're not
terrorists, they're robbers.

311
00:11:30,178 --> 00:11:32,212
They brought drilling equipment
to break into the safe.

312

robbers, two cops, and one Gina.

00:11:38,286 --> 00:11:40,187
Gina?

316
00:11:40,188 --> 00:11:42,055
There she is.
She went for the hairspray.

317
00:11:42,056 --> 00:11:44,658
She is incorrigible.

318
00:11:44,659 --> 00:11:46,794
- Who are you? Come here.
- No!

319
00:11:46,795 --> 00:11:49,363
No, no, no, no.
Jake, they're taking Gina.

320
00:11:49,364 --> 00:11:51,205
Yeah, I know.
We're looking at the same thing.

321
00:11:53,336 --> 00:11:55,237
What?
They got Gina?

322
00:11:55,238 --> 00:11:57,038
- I told you to watch her!
- <i>I know.</i>

323
00:11:57,073 --> 00:11:59,741
I am so sorry, but I promise
you, we will get her back.

324
00:11:59,776 --> 00:12:00,943
Oh, this is bad.

325
00:12:00,944 --> 00:12:02,444
I got to report this
to the Vulture.

326
00:12:02,445 --> 00:12:03,512
He's in charge.

327
00:12:03,513 --> 00:12:04,780
Ugh!
The Vulture?

328
00:12:04,781 --> 00:12:07,348
I thought he was on his massage
tour of Southeast Asia.

329
00:12:07,384 --> 00:12:08,717
He's leaving tomorrow.

330
00:12:08,718 --> 00:12:10,284
<i>That's why he wants this
over quickly.</i>

331
00:12:10,320 --> 00:12:11,987
- He wants to storm the building.
- No!

332
00:12:11,988 --> 00:12:14,123
No, no, no.
That is a bad idea.

333
00:12:14,124 --> 00:12:15,657
Look, we still haven't
figured out

334
00:12:15,658 --> 00:12:17,426
where they're holding Gina
and the rest of the hostages.

335
00:12:17,427 --> 00:12:18,761
If you guys come
busting in here,

336
00:12:18,762 --> 00:12:20,484
things could go sideways
real fast.

337
00:12:20,497 --> 00:12:22,364
That's what I told him,
but then he just

338
00:12:22,365 --> 00:12:23,599
repeated it back to me
in a lady's voice.

339
00:12:23,600 --> 00:12:24,799
<i>Listen to me, Sarge.</i>

340
00:12:24,834 --> 00:12:26,668
Boyle and I can take these guys
out one by one

341
00:12:26,669 --> 00:12:27,836
and no one will get hurt.

342
00:12:27,837 --> 00:12:29,338
Just ask the Vulture to give me
some more time.

343
00:12:29,339 --> 00:12:30,572
He'll be reasonable.

344
00:12:30,573 --> 00:12:32,074
What am I talking about?
It's the Vulture.

345
00:12:32,075 --> 00:12:34,977
Tell him Tila Tequila's doing
a free show in Central Park.

346
00:12:34,978 --> 00:12:36,712
Then how come Tila
just posted a selfie

347
00:12:36,713 --> 00:12:38,747
from the Kid Rock show
in Daytona, bro?

348
00:12:38,748 --> 00:12:40,082
Yeah, I follow her.
You know what?

349
00:12:40,083 --> 00:12:41,550
I know what's going on here.

350
00:12:41,551 --> 00:12:44,386
Jake wants to go solo, and he's
trying to steal my thunder.

351
00:12:44,387 --> 00:12:46,855
He's inside and he has eyes
on the situation.

352
00:12:46,856 --> 00:12:49,491
Look, I'm in command here.
Look around you.

353
00:12:49,492 --> 00:12:51,493
I control all of this.

354
00:12:51,494 --> 00:12:53,896
You see that guy behind you?
That sniper?

355
00:12:53,897 --> 00:12:56,131
He'll shoot whoever
I tell him to.

356
00:12:56,132 --> 00:12:57,132
Even you.

357
00:12:57,133 --> 00:12:58,534
- No, I won't.
- Fine.

358
00:12:58,535 --> 00:13:01,437
Then, uh, he'll sit
on any rooftop I tell him to.

359
00:13:01,438 --> 00:13:03,739
Hey, go sit on
that rooftop, guy.

360
00:13:03,740 --> 00:13:05,874
Look, just give Jake
a chance.

361
00:13:05,875 --> 00:13:08,076
If he fails, then you can
storm the building.

362
00:13:08,077 --> 00:13:09,878
I'll give him a chance
to sit on his little white butt

363
00:13:09,879 --> 00:13:11,479
and wait for me
to come rescue him.

364
00:13:11,514 --> 00:13:13,415
You tell him
that I'm Liam Neeson

365
00:13:13,416 --> 00:13:15,850
and he's my hot,
dumb daughter.

366
00:13:15,885 --> 00:13:17,583
All right, we're outnumbered
and unarmed.

367
00:13:17,587 --> 00:13:18,987
If we're gonna get Gina back,
we need weapons.

368
00:13:18,988 --> 00:13:20,756
This place sells
hammers, wrenches...

369
00:13:20,757 --> 00:13:22,024
Do they sell plants?

370
00:13:22,025 --> 00:13:24,560
Because some of
that potting soil is very toxic

371
00:13:24,561 --> 00:13:25,841
if ingested in large quantities.

372
00:13:25,862 --> 00:13:28,797
So you want to feed
the bad guys a lot of soil?

373
00:13:28,798 --> 00:13:29,932
Force-feed 'em.

374
00:13:29,933 --> 00:13:30,966
Okay, that's a good option

375
00:13:30,967 --> 00:13:32,434
that I will definitely consider.

376
00:13:32,435 --> 00:13:35,037
Now, let's go out there
and gear our asses up.

377
00:13:35,038 --> 00:13:37,306

00:14:22,519 --> 00:14:24,653
Oof!

398
00:14:24,654 --> 00:14:27,723
That'll teach you to have
a dumb, normal name.

399
00:14:27,724 --> 00:14:29,905
All right, where are you
holding the hostages?

400
00:14:29,926 --> 00:14:31,226
Oh, bet you'd
like to know, eh?

401
00:14:31,227 --> 00:14:32,961
Canadian?
No!

402
00:14:32,962 --> 00:14:35,197
You're so clearly
supposed to be German.

403
00:14:35,198 --> 00:14:37,165
- Are any of you German?
Mm-mm.

404
00:14:37,166 --> 00:14:38,233
- Russian?
Mm-mm.

405
00:14:38,234 --> 00:14:39,601
- North Korean?
- Mm-mm.

406
00:14:39,602 --> 00:14:40,802
Greek?

407
00:14:40,803 --> 00:14:42,209
I don't trust the way
the Greeks dance.

408
00:14:42,238 --> 00:14:43,472
No one does.

409
00:14:43,473 --> 00:14:45,040
<i>You there?</i>

410
00:14:45,041 --> 00:14:46,275
Oh.

411
00:14:46,276 --> 00:14:49,578
Uh, yeah, I was oot,
but now I'm back, eh?

412
00:14:49,579 --> 00:14:51,246
<i>Meet me in
the service corridor.</i>

413

<i>We've got a situation

414
00:14:53,917 --> 00:14:57,319
Okey dokey,
sorry to hear aboot that.

415
00:14:57,320 --> 00:14:58,319
Service corridor.

416
00:14:58,354 --> 00:15:01,657
- That was great, Jake.
- Thanks.

417
00:15:01,658 --> 00:15:04,326
Peralta just texted.
He knows where the hostages are.

418
00:15:04,327 --> 00:15:05,727
He wants 15 more minutes.

419
00:15:05,728 --> 00:15:07,296
And I want
my lesbian neighbors

420
00:15:07,297 --> 00:15:08,664
to be way hotter than they are,

421
00:15:08,665 --> 00:15:11,199
but we can't always get
what we want, right?

422
00:15:11,200 --> 00:15:12,935
I'm ordering that raid.
Hey!

423
00:15:12,936 --> 00:15:15,070
Give that back to me.
Are you serious?

424
00:15:15,071 --> 00:15:16,605
I will end your career.

425
00:15:16,606 --> 00:15:18,073
You'll be out there
working as a model

426
00:15:18,074 --> 00:15:19,975
because, well, you know,
you're shredded,

427
00:15:19,976 --> 00:15:21,410
and I respect that.

428
00:15:21,411 --> 00:15:22,710
Give me that walkie talkie,
now.

429
00:15:22,745 --> 00:15:24,813
Those are my people in there!

430
00:15:24,814 --> 00:15:27,883
You are not gonna give
that order!

431
00:15:27,884 --> 00:15:29,151
- Stand down.
- No.

432
00:15:29,152 --> 00:15:31,052
Stand down
or I'm gonna make you.

433
00:15:31,087 --> 00:15:34,056
Hey, you turds,
get off the roofs and help me!

434
00:15:34,057 --> 00:15:35,805
Get off your roofs!

435
00:15:35,825 --> 00:15:38,292
I can't do it.
I'm a wimp, just like you said.

436
00:15:38,328 --> 00:15:40,128
I didn't say that,
and I don't care if you go in.

437
00:15:40,129 --> 00:15:42,895
- Be honest. You're judging me.
- I'm really not.

438
00:15:42,899 --> 00:15:44,866
I am, a bit.

439
00:15:44,867 --> 00:15:47,002
No lies on Christmas.

Oh.

443

Captain? Rosa?
Oh, please hear me from land!

Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no, no,

I'm so sorry.
No, I'm not!

450

We have a crisis. We have to go.
Let's go.

00:16:33,182 --> 00:16:35,250
I'll tell you how
John McClane would do it.

The vents.

Ah, blast the AC,
they get chilly,

457
00:16:39,055 --> 00:16:40,255
they leave to find sweaters.

No, we're gonna

Classic use of vents.

Yeah.

470
00:17:17,590 --> 00:17:19,424
- Ah!
- Are you okay?

471
00:17:19,425 --> 00:17:20,659
Oh, my head hurts.

472
00:17:20,693 --> 00:17:24,162
Probably from being conked
on it.

473
00:17:24,163 --> 00:17:26,998
- How are you?
- I'm tied up. I'm scared.

474
00:17:26,999 --> 00:17:29,968
This guy hasn't stopped farting
for the last hour.

475
00:17:29,969 --> 00:17:32,037
I keep telling you,
it's not me.

476
00:17:32,038 --> 00:17:35,440
Ramon, do you really want
your last words to be a lie?

477
00:17:35,441 --> 00:17:37,576
Those aren't gonna be
your last words, Ramon, all right?

478
00:17:37,577 --> 00:17:39,177
We're all gonna be fine.

479
00:17:39,178 --> 00:17:40,245
They're gonna drill
into the safe,

480
00:17:40,246 --> 00:17:41,445
take the money, and then go.

481
00:17:41,480 --> 00:17:43,014
They don't need to drill
into the safe.

482
00:17:43,015 --> 00:17:44,683
They had my ID.
They already have all the cash.

483
00:17:44,684 --> 00:17:46,117
What?

484
00:17:46,118 --> 00:17:48,353
Then why'd they bring
all that heavy-duty equipment?

485
00:17:48,354 --> 00:17:51,156
So you're a cop.

486
00:17:51,157 --> 00:17:53,391
- Ah.
- I hate cops.

487
00:17:53,392 --> 00:17:55,493
- They gave me this.
- Nice!

488
00:17:55,494 --> 00:17:58,596
Finally, a good bad guy.
This dude gets it.

489
00:17:58,631 --> 00:17:59,731
Now I'm gonna kill you.

490
00:17:59,732 --> 00:18:01,066
Okay, you took it
a little too far.

491
00:18:01,067 --> 00:18:02,267
Maybe scale it back a skosh.

492
00:18:02,268 --> 00:18:04,769
<i>All set down here.</i>

493
00:18:04,770 --> 00:18:06,571
Okay, start loading out.

494
00:18:06,572 --> 00:18:09,074
I just have one piece
of business to take care of.

495
00:18:09,075 --> 00:18:12,611
You know, killing a man
is not as easy as it sounds.

496
00:18:12,612 --> 00:18:13,877
I've killed ten men.

497
00:18:13,913 --> 00:18:15,380
And that's such a nice,
round number.

498
00:18:15,381 --> 00:18:16,781
Wouldn't you agree?
I mean, imagine.

499
00:18:16,782 --> 00:18:20,952
"I've killed 11 people."
It just sounds so cumbersome.

500
00:18:23,956 --> 00:18:25,589
Ooh!

501
00:18:25,625 --> 00:18:28,025
Yippie kayak, other buckets!

502
00:18:28,060 --> 00:18:29,794
Boyle!
You did it!

503
00:18:29,795 --> 00:18:31,896
And you completely botched
the catchphrase.

504
00:18:31,897 --> 00:18:35,133
- I'm pretty sure it was right.
- No, but you did great.

505
00:18:35,134 --> 00:18:37,668
Ahh.

506
00:18:37,703 --> 00:18:38,870
All right.

507
00:18:38,871 --> 00:18:40,038
Look, we have to stop
the other robbers.

508
00:18:40,039 --> 00:18:41,338
They're escaping with the merch.

509
00:18:41,374 --> 00:18:42,507
How?

510
00:18:42,508 --> 00:18:44,175
Terry's got the place
surrounded.

511
00:18:44,176 --> 00:18:46,211
The drill.
It's not for the safe.

512
00:18:46,212 --> 00:18:47,746
They're using it
to tunnel out of here.

513
00:18:47,747 --> 00:18:49,080
And those farts
Gina kept smelling?

514
00:18:49,081 --> 00:18:51,883
- Uh-huh. They were Ramon.
- No, it was sewage.

515
00:18:51,884 --> 00:18:53,351
And Ramon.

516
00:18:53,352 --> 00:18:55,754
We have to tell Terry they're
escaping through the sewers.

517
00:18:55,755 --> 00:18:57,354
What's a brother got to do
to get a wet wipe?

518
00:18:57,390 --> 00:18:58,455
Don't say that.

"I'm starving"?
We had a thing going!

523
00:19:09,635 --> 00:19:13,371
Jake!
Oh, I'm so glad you're okay.

524
00:19:13,372 --> 00:19:14,706
Wow, you were really worried
about me?

525
00:19:14,707 --> 00:19:16,608
Mm-hmm, also your face
is so warm,

526
00:19:16,609 --> 00:19:18,275
and I think I have hypothermia.

Sergeant, we need to talk.

I'm not in trouble for what
I did to the Vulture, am I?

529
00:19:25,651 --> 00:19:27,661
You think people will believe
he threw himself in the garbage?

530
00:19:27,687 --> 00:19:28,853
No.

531
00:19:28,854 --> 00:19:30,588
But this was
a high-pressure situation,

532
00:19:30,589 --> 00:19:32,057
and you rose to the occasion.

533
00:19:32,058 --> 00:19:33,591
You may have
saved lives tonight.

534
00:19:33,592 --> 00:19:34,893
The squad is my family,

535
00:19:34,894 --> 00:19:36,861
and I'll always protect
my family.

536
00:19:36,862 --> 00:19:37,962
Except for Zeke.

537
00:19:37,963 --> 00:19:39,731
That deadbeat giant
can fend for himself.

538
00:19:39,732 --> 00:19:42,266
There's a Lieutenant's exam
coming up,

539
00:19:42,301 --> 00:19:43,768
and I think you should take it.

540
00:19:43,769 --> 00:19:45,721
It's the next step
to becoming a Captain.

541
00:19:45,738 --> 00:19:48,098
I didn't do anything.
It was all Jake and Charles.

542
00:19:48,107 --> 00:19:51,109
Mm, spoken like
a true Captain.

543
00:19:51,110 --> 00:19:52,176
Also, you are in trouble.

544
00:19:52,211 --> 00:19:53,677
You're suspended one week.

545
00:19:53,713 --> 00:19:56,648
But you've got a bright future.

546
00:19:56,649 --> 00:19:58,950
But I'll need
your badge and gun.

00:19:58,951 --> 00:20:00,351
Hey, buddy.

548
00:20:00,352 --> 00:20:02,253
I couldn't find the cologne
you wanted to give Amy,

549
00:20:02,254 --> 00:20:05,056
but I did get
a Canyon Stank gift set.

550
00:20:05,057 --> 00:20:08,193
It's all three stanks,
plus the body spray.

551
00:20:08,194 --> 00:20:11,528
- Oh, wow. Thanks, Charles.
- Yeah.

552
00:20:11,564 --> 00:20:14,699
Look, I didn't forget
Amy's gift.

553
00:20:14,700 --> 00:20:16,868
I forgot yours.

554
00:20:16,869 --> 00:20:18,502
The Canyon Stank was for you.

555
00:20:18,537 --> 00:20:21,473
What?
Why didn't you just tell me?

556
00:20:21,474 --> 00:20:22,941
Oh, because it would have
crushed my heart

557
00:20:22,942 --> 00:20:24,042
and ruined our friendship.

558
00:20:24,043 --> 00:20:25,110
Good call.

559
00:20:25,111 --> 00:20:27,545
Look, it sucks,
and I was selfish.

560
00:20:27,546 --> 00:20:28,713
I should have gotten you
something better.

561
00:20:28,714 --> 00:20:29,748
You did.

562
00:20:29,749 --> 00:20:31,916
You surrendered yourself
to keep me safe.

563
00:20:31,917 --> 00:20:35,053
Not only that, you sacrificed
your John McClane moment.

564
00:20:35,054 --> 00:20:37,621
It should have been you saying,
"Yippie kayak, other buckets!"

565
00:20:37,656 --> 00:20:39,758
Ah, I know you have
the moral high ground right now,

566
00:20:39,759 --> 00:20:40,825
but it still makes me so angry.
